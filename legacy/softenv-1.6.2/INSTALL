Installation Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  A few things to know.

    By default, SoftEnv is installed with /usr/local as it's PREFIX,
    and /etc as it's ETC_PREFIX.  This means that the following are
    your installed directory locations.  Each of these can be changed
    by the corresponding variable indicated on the left.
        
        PREFIX              /usr/local
        BIN_DIR             $PREFIX/bin
        MAN_DIR             $PREFIX/share/man
        DOC_DIR             $PREFIX/share/doc/softenv-$VERSION

        ETC_PREFIX          /etc
        SOFTENV_ETC_DIR     $ETC_PREFIX/softenv
        PROFILE_DIR         $ETC_PREFIX/profile.d

    For example, if you want to install SoftEnv in a standard way for
    creating a package for a distribution, you might use:

        make PREFIX=/usr install
    
    Or if you want _everything_ in a special location, including your
    etc files, you could do a:

        make PREFIX=/my/location ETC_PREFIX=/my/location/etc install


2)  Now do your install.

    a)  Standard install:

        make install

    b)  Recommended install for package creators:

        make PREFIX=/usr install


3)  Customize your softenv.db file.

    You will find this file in SOFTENV_ETC_DIR (/etc/softenv by default).
    Open it in your favorite editor, and you will find instructions at 
    the top.


Have fun!
