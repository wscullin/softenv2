- Replace install w/ mkdir in Makefile
- In scripts/install-N-sub, use installbsd if it's available (for AIX, Tru64)
- Add missing export variables in profile.d/softenv.sh

Version 1.6.2      28 February 2007    JP Navarro <navarro@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New ability create a new .soft for users by copying a template_softenv file
  added to softenv-load.* scripts
- Removed code to copy default .soft from profile.d scripts

Version 1.6.1      12 January  2007    JP Navarro <navarro@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed bug in 'soft add ..' where export was missing
- Fixed bug in 'soft remove ..' where @removals var used should be %removals
- New 'soft append ..' option to append to acumulator vars
  Instead of 'soft add ..' preprend
- New 'softenv -c' option to list in Condor ClassAd format
- Make keyword -k searches case insensitive (John Valdes <valdes@mcs.anl.gov>)
- Handle long keywords by printing two lines (John Valdes <valdes@mcs.anl.gov>)
- New 'softenv -x' option to list in XML format 
- Backed out the .soft to .softenvrc rename because it impacts users too much

Version 1.6.0      1 September 2003    Brian Finley <finley@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- De-MCSized as much as possible
- Moved to a more standard build system (Makefile, etc.)
- Install in a _more_ LSB compliant way (/etc/softenv, /usr/bin, etc.) (still
  needs work, but didn't want to make too many changes at once)
- Standard initialization files installed in /etc/profile.d as softenv.sh and
  softenv.csh
- User's run control file is now called ".softenvrc" instead of ".soft"
- Implement JP Navarro's /etc/softenv/softenvrc.default idea -- the system 
  administrator gets to create this file, which will be copied to the user's
  .softenvrc file, if the user has no .softenvrc file.  This allows greater 
  flexibility, and gets away from the previously hard coded default of 
  "@default".
- If user has no .softenvrc file, and the system administrator has not created
  an /etc/softenv/softenvrc.default, exit cleanly without mucking up the 
  environment.
- Change file names from "soft<whatever>" to "softenv<whatever>"
- Distribute rpms
- Provide example databases
- Heavily modified the STRING substitution during make-time tool.  Now
  called install-N-sub.  Source files are no longer modified directly, but
  are kept pristine.  String substitution changes are now made as files are
  being installed.
- Added the following architectures to softenv.config.pl:
    linux-tg
    linux-sles8-ia32
    linux-sles8-ia64

Version 1.4.2      26 October 2002     Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Fixed bug in zsh (and maybe bash) where the PATH would be cleared, and
   then $ARCH would attempt to be set to /bin/whatami.  But whatami would
   have problems because there is no path.

Version 1.4.1      16 October 2002     Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Made all of SoftEnv not dependent on whatami.  An architecture
   identification program is configurable in softenv.config.pl.  Also, the
   first command in the cache files will set $ARCH to the output of this
   program.
 - Updated the docs to not mention MCS specific information (except
   softenv-policy)

Version 1.4.0      14 September 2002   Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Changed how the INITIALIZED and ACCUMULATED vars are done.  When
   something is added at the beginning of the cache, they need to be
   removed at the end.
 - Added the ordered flag for keywords, so that the environment variables
   or commands or source files can be executed in the order specified
 - Added architecture specifications for macros, so that macros for some
   architecture are not executed on other architectures
 - Made it possible to use 'soft add' and 'soft delete' with macros
 - Added the 'source' command, to source external files
 - Documentation for the new features
 - A few minor bugfixes
 - A few documentation fixes

Version 1.3.0      30 May 2000         Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added soft-menu to give users a menu to choose from
 - Added soft-dbq to query the database
 - Fixed small bugs or annoyances
 - Made better error messages
 - Added != checking to econs and if statements
 - use strict on everything :)
 - debug setting

Version 1.2.0      26 January 2000     Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added database 'pointer' feature
 - Added database 'command' feature
 - Changed %initialize section to differentiate by architecture
 - Added a "OLD LOCK FILE" error in soft-msc
 - Yet another installation

Version 1.1.0      20 December 1999    Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added 'soft add|delete' functionality, changed docs
 - Hopefully final installation

Version 1.0.0      24 November 1999    Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Final Installation

Version 0.9.7      1 November 1999     Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Rearranged packaging directory.  Not too visible in the release
 - 'softcheck' database feature is in, same with the weblog.

Version 0.9.5      October 1999        Alan <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Most of the new features are into the code, such as econs and removals,
   with an almost complete release
 - Not a lot of documentation yet though

Version 0.9.0      Early 1999          r'm <evard@mcs.anl.gov>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Renamed Soft to SoftEnv, also with major changes in the code
