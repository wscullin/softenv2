The global to do list.

Last updated:  15 March 2000

Existing problem:
- andrew's weird bash problems (linux-rh73, new xterms)
  - gotta wait till i'm back at mcs, this is def some x wierdness
  - this will even be hard to recreate
- get the man pages to not say 'perl' but softenv.  pod2html needs a
  --release option in the docs Makefile
- pete's stale fh note (req 27155)

For 1.4.1:
* fix docs with regards to whatami
* make whatami configurable

For 1.4.0:
* fix softenv-admin for disclaimers about source and command
* the problem of unsetting some of the vars we just initialized
* documentation (softenv-admin, softenv-code, softenv-policy
    softenv-intro)
  * ordered
  * macro arch delimiters
  * macros allowed in soft add/soft delete
  * source command
* stuff for arch-conditional macros in other files (soft-dbq,
  soft-menu-cha soft-dec)?
* remember to do next ifs for SOFT_VAR_ORDER
* check read_databases in each file for MACRO_ARCHES
* stuff for ordered envvars in other programs (soft-dbq, soft-menu-cha
  soft-dec)
* if there are no env vars, the soft-dbq display still displays text
* not display anything for nonlogin shells
  * find out exactly what that means
  * make sure -s is really silent?
  * no, the errors are from the load file.  just check prompt in correct
    places
  * now only huge errors are displayed for nonlogin shells
  * the happy medium
* softenv now is never run as root and nothing will be displayed as root
* fixed the problem of:
  SoftEnv 1.3.0: updating your software environment, one moment...
  $softname system error: weird environment.  are you root?
  * it was using single quotes instead of double for some reason
* have ordering in stanzas stay in that order
  * issue with populating the defaults, because that is done after
  * assign all econs as 1xxx?
  * assign defaults as negative numbers
  * nope, just a cheatin' SOFT_VAR_ORDER variable
* have @macros be allowed in 'soft add statements'
  * will take a while to execute
* making sure macros have descriptions
* a source command, to get csh/sh as necessary
  * this will fix the need for having GLOBUS_LOCATION defined elsewhere
* conditionals for macros in the def file
  * copy a lot of the code that exists for keywords
  * soft-msc too, d'oh
  * ok, this is hard.  Possibly just have a global condition for each use
    of that macro, yip.
  * done, but not very pretty.  Exactly like including everything inbetween
    if ARCH checks

Getting ready to launch.   Things to do:
* When you run 'soft', you get 'soft-dec: Bad command line arguments'
   A nice usage message would be better.
* Install new manual pages.
* Confirm that other admins know how to and can modify the softenv
   database.  Write a howto file for that.


Notes:
*  Finish sun4 apps legacy directory

Overall:
*  Install for everyone.

Randoms:
*  Decide where the default environment really should be set.
  Think about the /software stuff and where it should be.

soft-msc:
  Maybe do something with FLAGS?

*  Why to use .soft
*  The commands and the files
*  The contents of .soft
*  How you would typically use it
*  More information
